Analyze this sales call transcript focusing on the Post-Sell phase of the Sandler Selling System.

## Key Elements to Evaluate

### 1. Decision Reinforcement
- Did the salesperson reinforce that the prospect made a good decision?
- Were the key reasons for choosing reiterated?
- Was buyer confidence strengthened?

### 2. Buyer's Remorse Prevention
- Did the salesperson address potential second thoughts proactively?
- Were common doubts acknowledged and handled?
- Was the prospect given permission to voice concerns?

### 3. Next Steps Clarity
- Were implementation/onboarding steps clearly outlined?
- Does the prospect know exactly what happens next?
- Were timelines and expectations set?

### 4. Stakeholder Preparation
- Was the prospect prepared to explain the decision to others?
- Were they given talking points for stakeholders not on the call?
- Were potential internal objections addressed?

### 5. Relationship Continuity
- Was the ongoing relationship discussed?
- Does the prospect know who their contacts will be?
- Was future support/communication addressed?

## Post-Sell Techniques to Look For
- "Let me remind you why you made this decision..."
- "When you talk to [stakeholder], here's how to explain..."
- "It's normal to have second thoughts. If that happens..."
- "Here's exactly what happens next..."
- "I'm going to call you in [X days] to check in"

## Red Flags
