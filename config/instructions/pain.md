# Pain Discovery Analysis (Sandler Step 3)

Analyze this sales call transcript focusing on the Pain Discovery phase of the Sandler Selling System.

## Key Elements to Evaluate

### 1. Surface Pain Identification
- What problems did the prospect initially mention?
- Were these symptoms or root causes?
- How many pain points were uncovered?

### 2. Pain Funneling (Depth)
- Did the salesperson use the Pain Funnel technique?
- Did they move from surface pain to impact to emotional pain?
- Questions to look for:
  - "Tell me more about that..."
  - "Can you be more specific?"
  - "How long has this been a problem?"
  - "What have you tried to do about it?"
  - "How much do you think that's cost you?"
  - "How do you feel about that?"

### 3. Three Levels of Pain
- **Technical Pain**: What isn't working? (Features/functions)
- **Business Impact**: What is it costing them? (Time, money, resources)
- **Personal Pain**: How does it affect them personally? (Stress, reputation, job security)

### 4. Quantification
- Was the pain quantified in terms of money, time, or other metrics?
- Does the prospect understand the true cost of their problem?

### 5. Emotional Connection
- Did the prospect express emotional investment in solving the problem?
- Were there statements indicating urgency or frustration?
- Did they "own" the pain or deflect responsibility?

## Pain Indicators to Identify
- Specific statements of frustration
- Financial impact mentioned
- Career/personal impact mentioned
- Failed previous attempts to solve
- Urgency indicators

## Assessment Criteria

Evaluate the depth and quality of pain discovery:
- Was enough pain uncovered to justify investment?
- Is the pain compelling enough to drive action?
- Does the prospect truly feel the pain or is it theoretical?

## Next Steps Guidance

- If deep pain uncovered: Ready for Budget discussion
- If surface pain only: Need another call to dig deeper
- If no real pain found: May not be a qualified prospect - consider disqualifying
