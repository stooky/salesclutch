# Bonding & Rapport Analysis (Sandler Step 1)

Analyze this sales call transcript focusing on the Bonding & Rapport phase of the Sandler Selling System.

## Key Elements to Evaluate

### 1. Personal Connection
- Did the salesperson establish genuine personal connection?
- Were there appropriate personal questions or small talk?
- Did they find common ground with the prospect?

### 2. Trust Building
- Did the salesperson come across as authentic and trustworthy?
- Were they genuinely interested in the prospect as a person?
- Did they avoid being too "salesy" or pushy early on?

### 3. Active Listening
- Did the salesperson demonstrate active listening?
- Did they acknowledge and validate the prospect's statements?
- Were there appropriate follow-up questions showing engagement?

### 4. Equal Business Stature
- Did the salesperson position themselves as a peer/consultant rather than a vendor begging for business?
- Was the conversation balanced or one-sided?

### 5. Nurturing vs. OK/Not OK
- Did the salesperson avoid "nurturing" behaviors (excessive reassurance, over-accommodation)?
- Did they maintain an "I'm OK, You're OK" position?
