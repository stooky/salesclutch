# Fulfillment/Presentation Analysis (Sandler Step 6)

Analyze this sales call transcript focusing on the Fulfillment phase of the Sandler Selling System.

## Key Elements to Evaluate

### 1. Pain-Solution Connection
- Did the presentation directly address the specific pains uncovered?
- Were features tied to the prospect's stated problems?
- Was the solution positioned as the answer to THEIR issues (not generic benefits)?

### 2. Budget Alignment
- Was the investment presented in context of the value/ROI?
- Did it match the budget previously discussed?
- Were there any surprises about cost?

### 3. Decision Criteria Addressed
- Did the presentation cover the decision criteria identified earlier?
- Were all stakeholder concerns addressed?
- Did it differentiate from competition appropriately?

### 4. Presentation Style
- Was it consultative or "pitch-y"?
- Did the salesperson check for understanding throughout?
- Were there opportunities for prospect input and questions?

### 5. Thermometer Checks
- Did the salesperson ask how the prospect was feeling throughout?
- Were concerns identified and addressed in real-time?
- Was there two-way dialogue or a monologue?

## What to Look For
- "Based on what you told me about [pain], here's how we address that..."
- "You mentioned [criteria] was important. Let me show you..."
- "On a scale of 1-10, where are you right now?"
- "What questions do you have about what I've shown you?"

## Red Flags
- Generic feature dump not tied to their pain
- New objections surfacing (missed in earlier steps)
- Prospect disengaged or distracted
- Price shock (budget wasn't properly qualified)
- "That's interesting, but we really need X" (wrong solution fit)

## Assessment Criteria

Evaluate presentation effectiveness:

- Is the prospect ready to move forward?

## Next Steps Guidance
