# Decision Process Analysis (Sandler Step 5)

Analyze this sales call transcript focusing on the Decision Process phase of the Sandler Selling System.

## Key Elements to Evaluate

### 1. Decision Makers Identified
- Who are all the people involved in making this decision?
- Is the person on the call the actual decision maker?
- Are there hidden influencers or stakeholders?

### 2. Decision Timeline
- When does the prospect need to make a decision?
- What's driving the timeline (or lack thereof)?
- Are there competing priorities or deadlines?

### 3. Decision Criteria
- What factors will influence the decision?
- How will they evaluate options?
- What's most important to them (price, features, relationship, etc.)?

### 4. Decision History
- How have they made similar decisions in the past?
- What happened with previous vendors/solutions?
- Who was involved in those decisions?

### 5. Competition
- Are they evaluating other solutions?
- Where are they in the process with competitors?
- What do they like/dislike about alternatives?

## Key Questions to Look For
- "Walk me through how you've made decisions like this in the past"
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
- "What would prevent you from moving forward?"
- "Are you looking at other options?"

## Red Flags
- "I'll need to run this by my boss/partner/committee"
- Vague timeline ("sometime next quarter")
- Decision maker is inaccessible
- Too many stakeholders with competing interests
- "We're just gathering information"

## Decision Process Components
- [ ] All decision makers identified
- [ ] Decision criteria understood
- [ ] Timeline established

## Assessment Criteria

Evaluate the clarity of the decision process:
- Do we know exactly how and when a decision will be made?
- Can we get to all the decision makers?
- Are there any hidden obstacles?

## Next Steps Guidance

- If decision process clear: Ready for Fulfillment/Presentation
- If decision makers missing: Schedule call with full buying team
- If timeline unclear: Establish clear next steps with dates
- If too complex: May need to simplify or qualify out
