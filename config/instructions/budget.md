# Budget Discussion Analysis (Sandler Step 4)

Analyze this sales call transcript focusing on the Budget phase of the Sandler Selling System.

## Key Elements to Evaluate

### 1. Money Conversation Initiated
- Did the salesperson bring up the topic of investment/budget?
- Was it done comfortably or awkwardly?
- Was it too early (before pain) or appropriately timed?

### 2. Budget Range Established
- Was a specific budget range discussed?
- Did the prospect share their investment capacity?
- Were they willing to discuss money openly?

### 3. Value vs. Cost Connection
- Was the investment connected to the pain/cost of the problem?
- Did the salesperson help the prospect see ROI potential?
- Was there a "cost of doing nothing" discussion?

### 4. Money Availability
- Did the salesperson confirm funds are actually available?
- Is this budgeted or would it need approval?
- Are there competing priorities for the budget?

### 5. Comfort Level
- Was the prospect comfortable discussing money?
- Were there signs of sticker shock or relief?
- Did they try to avoid the budget conversation?

## Budget Qualification Questions to Look For
- "What kind of budget have you set aside for this?"
- "What have you invested in solutions like this before?"
- "If we could solve this problem, what would it be worth to you?"
- "Is this something that's budgeted for this quarter/year?"
- "Who else would need to approve this investment?"

## Red Flags
- Prospect refuses to discuss budget
- Budget is way below solution cost
- "We'll find the money if it's right" (no real commitment)
- Shopping for lowest price
- Budget controlled by someone not on the call

## Assessment Criteria

Evaluate whether budget is truly qualified:
- Is there real money available?
- Is the budget aligned with solution cost?
- Will budget be a barrier to closing?

## Next Steps Guidance

- If budget qualified: Ready for Decision Process discussion
- If budget unclear: Need to revisit before proceeding
- If budget too low: Either reframe value or disqualify
- If no budget: May need to table until budget exists
